            <td>The Alfredo Pasta is an Italian pasta dish made using fresh pasta, vegetables, chicken pieces combined with butter, cream and cheese. As the cheese melts, it results in a creamy, rich cheese sauce that coats the pasta. It is without a doubt one of the most delicious and simple dishes to prepare at home.</td>
            <td>Pesto is that wonderfully green sauce that offers a flavor that can best be described as bright and pungent, with a basil-forward, herbaceous garden aroma suspended with delicate olive oil, enriched with pine nuts (pignoli), and kicked into overdrive with Italian cheeses and garlic.</td>
            <td>Rasta pasta is an Italian-Jamaican fusion recipe where pasta is tossed with a jerk-infused sauce and colorful bell peppers. You can add the protein of choice to it, chicken being the most popular. I have also made it with shrimp and pork and it is equally delicious.</td>
